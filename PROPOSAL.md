# Project Proposal

## Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!)

- [ ] Connect 4

## Project Description 

 My game app Connect 4, is a classic two-player strategy board game, recreated for a digital platform. This project will use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a web-based version, allowing players to enjoy the timeless gameplay in a modern, user-friendly interface. The objective is to create a responsive and interactive game that mimics the traditional Connect 4 experience, where players alternate turns to drop colored discs into a vertical grid, aiming to connect four discs in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. First to achieve this task wins the game.

## Psuedocodes:     
- Creating a 2D array to represent the game board
- Implementing functions to handle player moves and turn switching
- Implement a function to detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal winning conditions.
- Developing a function to check for winning conditions
- Using DOM manipulation to update the visual representation of the game board
- Adding event listeners to handle user interactions

## User Stories
- **AAU,** I want to be able to place my piece in a column so that I can make my move.
- **AAU,** I want the game to automatically switch turns after each move so that I can play against an opponent.
- **AAU,** I want the game to detect when four pieces are connected (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) so that a winner can be determined.
- **AAU,** I want to see a visual representation of the game board so that I can easily understand the current state of the game.
- **AAU,** I want to be notified when the game is over (win, lose, or draw) so that I know when to start a new game.
- **AAU,** I want to be able to reset a game once its done.

#### MVP Goals
- Basic 6x7 game board
- Two player turn-based gameplay
- Simple UI for placing pieces in columns
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections
- Game over state (win/draw) display
- Option to start a new game after completion

#### Stretch Goals

- AAU, I would like a scoreboard to keep track on my wins and losses!
- AAU, I would like to hear an audible sound when I mark a game box so that I know my selection worked.
- AAU, I would like to play this game to have a game music track.
- AAU, I would like to see the ability to pick other colors for your chips other than the generic red and black.
